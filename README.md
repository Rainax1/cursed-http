%% Welcome to The Amazing HTTP Server â€“ an extraordinary piece of software that will leave you questioning. If you're looking for the pinnacle of HTTP server technology, you've come to the right place (or maybe not).

# Features

Echo Functionality: Echo your innermost thoughts by navigating to `/echo/your_message_here`. Brace yourself for mind-bending experiences!

Secret Files: Visit `/secret` to access a top-secret file. It's so secret that even we don't know what's in it!

User-Agent Retrieval: Ever wondered what your User-Agent is? Find out by hitting up `/user-agent`. Spoiler: It's probably something like "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36."
